        My first experience with world of web development was during my
        highscool. During classes on Information Technologies, besides basic
        knowledge of computer science, I was introduced to HTML, CSS and Weebly
        platform. I was fascinated with the idea of creating something out of
        nothing.

        At that time, I was playing lead guitar in a rock band, so obviously,
        for the final project, I decided to create a website for the band using
        a Weebly platform. ðŸŽ¸
      </p>
