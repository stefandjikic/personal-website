          My first experience with web development occurred during my high
          school years. In my Information Technologies classes, I not only
          learned the fundamentals of computer science but also got introduced
          to HTML, CSS, and the Weebly platform. The idea of creating something
          from scratch fascinated me.

          During that time, I was also the lead guitarist in a rock band.
          Naturally, for my final project, I chose to utilize the Weebly
          platform to create a website for the band. ðŸŽ¸

          forward to after graduating from a non-technical college, I found
          myself in a job that provided no satisfaction or sense of making a
          difference. It was then that I made the decision to dive into the
          world of web development and embark on a self-teaching journey.

          Despite already having a solid knowledge of HTML/CSS and JS, I decided
          to enroll in a bootcamp to meet like-minded people and expand my
          knowledge.

          two months later, my first full-time job as a frontend developer!
